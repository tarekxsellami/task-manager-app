# Task Manager App

I'm creating a simple and efficient Task Manager app to help users stay organized and on top of their daily tasks.

## Features:

- **Organized Main Screen:** View all tasks grouped by date for an easy overview of your schedule.
- **Add Tasks:** Include a start date, end date, name, description, and priority level to keep your tasks detailed and prioritized.
- **Edit Tasks:** Make changes to tasks to keep your plans flexible.
- **Search Function:** Quickly find any task with a simple search.

Letâ€™s collaborate together and make task management easier for everyone!

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several key packages to keep code clean, modular, and easy to navigate:

- **core** - Contains the core, reusable components like the repository, data models, and database access.
- **di** - Manages dependency injection modules, making it easy to inject dependencies throughout the app.
- **ui** - Contains the UI components and view models for each screen in the app, handling user interactions.
- **utils** - Contains utility classes and functions that support various features across the app.
